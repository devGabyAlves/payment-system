# Real-Time Payment Notification API

## Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of an API using Flask that incorporates real-time notifications with the WebSocket protocol using the Flask-SocketIO library. The API supports payment creation, QR Code generation, and a dedicated class for handling PIX payments. Additionally, it includes endpoints for payment processing and QR Code serving, WebSocket configuration for client connection and disconnection, and a testing file for data verification.

## Features

- **Real-Time Notifications**: Implemented using Flask-SocketIO to notify clients in real-time.
- **Payment Creation**: Endpoints to create and manage payments.
- **QR Code Generation**: Generate and serve QR Codes for payments.
- **PIX Integration**: Dedicated class for handling PIX payments.
- **Organized Endpoints**: Payment-based endpoint organization for easier updates and maintenance.
- **WebSocket Management**: Client connection and disconnection handling for real-time updates.
- **Testing**: Includes a testing file to verify data and file creation using pytest.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/devGabyAlves/payment-system.git
    cd payment-system
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

2. **Access the API**:
    - Open your browser or use a tool like Postman to interact with the API endpoints.

## Endpoints

- **/create_payment**: Endpoint to create a new payment.
- **/generate_qr_code**: Endpoint to generate a QR Code for a payment.
- **/serve_qr_code/<payment_id>**: Serve the generated QR Code.
- **/confirm_payment**: Confirm a payment and notify connected clients.
  
## WebSocket

- **Connection**: Handle client connections.
- **Disconnection**: Handle client disconnections.
- **Notifications**: Send real-time payment confirmations to connected clients.

## Testing

To run the tests with pytest:
```bash
pytest
